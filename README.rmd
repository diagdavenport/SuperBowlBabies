#Introduction

A budding interest of mine is creating visualizations from various intersections of complex analytics and pop culture. Somewhere close to the center of American pop culture is the world of professional sports; and somewhere near the center of that world is the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl has grown to be a defining American event for football devotees and detractors alike-regardless of whether you care about the game, either the highlights, the halftime show, or the commercials find their way into your Monday water cooler conversations.
 
#Problem Description

During an otherwise underwhelming Super Bowl 50, a commercial made the (cute, but suspicious) claim that the cities of the Super Bowl winning team experience increased birth rates in the nine months or so following the Super Bowl win. It is a well-known national marketing fact that the greater part of the country tunes in to the Super Bowl, but the implications for a measurable effect at the city level are significant.

There are both private and public considerations. For industry, perhaps there are increased opportunities for contraception sales close to the big game, or maybe increased demand for toys nine months later. From the government perspective, it seems that there ought to be an interest in building demand expectations for pre- and post-natal care in public facilities.

This exploration will focus on implications for local hospitals. The analysis will serve as an investigation into the demand for pre- and post-natal care as a function of major sports league outcomes. When this relationship is well-understood, hospitals and other care facilities will be better equipped to deal with predictable fluctuations in demand.
